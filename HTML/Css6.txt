1. What is position property in CSS and its type?
Ans: The position property in CSS specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. There are five different position values:

Static: This is the default value. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
Relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
Fixed: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
Absolute: The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
Sticky: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.

2. How many types of positioning are there in CSS?
Ans:There are five types of positioning in CSS: static, relative, fixed, absolute, and sticky.
3. What is Z-index and why to use it?
Ans: The z-index property in CSS is used to specify the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order. z-index is especially useful when elements overlap each other, as it helps to control which element should be displayed on top. It only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).
